SMRT Banners
===========

This is just a quick webapp to make it easier to test iOS 6 smart banners.
Alls you need to do is plug in the iTunes ID of the app you'd like to check
and hit create. This will reload the page with the appropriate meta tag
inserted to have the banner appear.

Please forgive the styling and general crappiness of the site. I'm certainly
*not* a web guy, but I wanted to try out one of these crazy grid frameworks
I've been hearing all about
